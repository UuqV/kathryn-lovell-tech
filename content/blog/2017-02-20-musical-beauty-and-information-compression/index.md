[This paper](http://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-0500-4-9#CR33) expounds upon a hypothesis which to me explains a lot. Although the paper itself asserts that this is just a hypothesis, this hypothesis has a lot of implications for music theory as well as the music industry if it holds. I'd love to use apparent complexity and Kolmogorov complexity as weights in a machine learning algorithm that attempts to filter submitted works to a publishing company for a certain amount of "quality."
